JULIAN'S LEGENDARY WHISKY GLASS

Description: The legendary whisky glass that embodies luxury, resilience, and a hint of danger. More than just a drinking vessel, it’s a symbol of Julian’s unwavering coolness. Always filled with whisky and a hint of ice, this glass stays in Julian’s hand through thick and thin – whether he's in the middle of a brawl, a tense negotiation, or even falling onto a lawn. Unbreakable and unbothered, just like its owner.

History: Originating from the “Trailer Park,” this glass became Julian’s one true companion. It is said to have been enchanted to never be empty—but only when Julian is around, of course. Over time, the glass has become more than just an object; it's a symbol of Julian’s legend.

Properties:

Material: Crafted from magical crystal, it’s completely unbreakable—no matter how many times it’s tossed, dropped, or used in a heated argument.
Contents: Always filled with whisky, and never anything less than "perfect." There’s an endless supply, just for Julian.
Special Abilities: The glass has a magical aura that provides instant calm and authority to whoever holds it (which, of course, is always Julian).
Limitations: Despite its powerful properties, no one else can hold it with the same grace or wield its authority like Julian can.
Current Status: Forever held in Julian’s hand, never to be borrowed. It’s his most trusted possession and a permanent fixture in his daily life.

Notable Events:

Survived three brawls, two fires, and one police chase: This glass has truly been through it all, coming out unscathed every single time.
Witnessed the signing of “the best business deal ever” – which failed spectacularly: It was there when Julian thought he had it all figured out, only to see the deal collapse in true legendary fashion.
Still full, even after a full day in the "improvised bar": The whisky never runs out, no matter how long Julian’s night lasts.
